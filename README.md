# Sorting Visualizer

### Why have I made this

I struggled with understanding how different Sorting Algorithms worked, and I wanted to have a way of displaying and comparing sorting algorithms to eachother. 

### How to run?

Go to terminal and write

```
npm run dev
```

then go to the localhost found in your terminal (```http://localhost:5173/```)

### Expand the app

If you want to expand the app with more sorting algorithms you can have a look at how I have made the others. All algorithms are exported to ```components/SortingVisualizer.tsx``` through ```algorithms/index.ts``` which is in the same file as all the sorting algorithms.
